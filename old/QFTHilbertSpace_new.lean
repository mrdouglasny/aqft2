/-! ## Multiplication Operators on L² Spaces

This file implements multiplication operators on L² spaces using bounded continuous functions.
The key insight is that bounded continuous functions give natural multiplication operators
with clear operator norm bounds.

**Main Theorem**: If ϕ : ℝ → ℂ is bounded and continuous, then multiplication by ϕ
gives a bounded linear operator on L²(ℝ) with ‖T_ϕ‖ ≤ ‖ϕ‖∞.

**Test Cases**:
1. Constant functions: ϕ(x) = c
2. Sine function: ϕ(x) = sin(x)

/-- **Main Theorem**: Multiplication by a bounded continuous function gives a bounded operator on L².

Mathematical content: If ϕ : ℝ → ℂ is bounded and continuous, then the pointwise
multiplication operator T_ϕ(f) = ϕ · f defines a bounded linear operator on L²(ℝ)
with operator norm ‖T_ϕ‖ ≤ ‖ϕ‖∞.

This is the fundamental result we need for QFT applications. -/
def mulL2_BoundedContinuous (ϕ : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ) :
    Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) →L[ℂ] Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) := by
  -- Strategy: Use the fact that ϕ coerces to a bounded function ℝ → ℂ
  -- and pointwise multiplication preserves L² with the right norm bound
  sorry

/-! ## Test Cases -/

/-- **Test Case 1**: Constant function multiplication.
If c : ℂ is a constant, then multiplication by c gives a bounded operator
with norm exactly |c|. -/
def mulL2_constant (c : ℂ) :
    Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) →L[ℂ] Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) :=
  -- The constant function as a BoundedContinuousFunction
  let ϕ_const : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ :=
    ⟨ContinuousMap.const ℝ c, ‖c‖, fun x => by simp⟩
  mulL2_BoundedContinuous ϕ_const

/-- **Test Case 2**: Sine function multiplication.
The sine function sin : ℝ → ℂ is bounded with ‖sin‖∞ = 1, so multiplication by sin
gives a bounded operator with norm ≤ 1. -/
def mulL2_sin :
    Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) →L[ℂ] Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) := by
  -- First, show that Complex.sin is bounded
  have sin_bounded : ∃ M, ∀ x : ℝ, ‖Complex.sin x‖ ≤ M := by
    use 1
    intro x
    -- For real x, |sin(x)| ≤ 1
    have h : abs (Complex.sin x) ≤ 1 := by
      rw [Complex.abs_sin_real]
      exact abs_sin_le_one x
    rwa [Complex.abs_eq_norm] at h

  -- Create the bounded continuous function
  have sin_continuous : Continuous (Complex.sin ∘ (coe : ℝ → ℂ)) := by
    exact Complex.continuous_sin.comp continuous_of_real

  let ϕ_sin : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ :=
    ⟨⟨Complex.sin ∘ (coe : ℝ → ℂ), sin_continuous⟩, 1, fun x => by
      have h : abs (Complex.sin x) ≤ 1 := by
        rw [Complex.abs_sin_real]
        exact abs_sin_le_one x
      rwa [Complex.abs_eq_norm] at h
    ⟩

/-! ## Verification Examples -/

/-- **Example 1**: Applying constant multiplication to an L² function. -/
example (c : ℂ) (f : Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)) :
    Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) :=
  (mulL2_constant c) f

/-- **Example 2**: Applying sine multiplication to an L² function. -/
example (f : Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)) :
    Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ) :=
  mulL2_sin f

/-- **Linearity check**: Both operators are linear. -/
example (c d : ℂ) (f g : Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)) :
    (mulL2_constant c) (f + d • g) = (mulL2_constant c) f + d • (mulL2_constant c) g := by
  rw [map_add, map_smul]

example (c : ℂ) (f g : Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)) :
    mulL2_sin (f + c • g) = mulL2_sin f + c • mulL2_sin g := by
  rw [map_add, map_smul]

/-- **Norm bounds**: The operator norms are bounded by the supremum norms. -/
example (c : ℂ) : ‖mulL2_constant c‖ ≤ ‖c‖ := by
  -- This should follow from the general theorem
  sorry

example : ‖mulL2_sin‖ ≤ 1 := by
  -- Since ‖sin‖∞ = 1, we have ‖T_sin‖ ≤ 1
  sorry

/-! ## General Properties

These are the key mathematical properties that make bounded continuous function
multiplication useful for QFT applications.
-/

/-- **Multiplicativity**: Composition of multiplication operators corresponds to
pointwise multiplication of the functions. -/
example (ϕ ψ : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ) :
    (mulL2_BoundedContinuous ϕ) ∘L (mulL2_BoundedContinuous ψ) =
    mulL2_BoundedContinuous (ϕ * ψ) := by
  sorry

/-- **Identity**: Multiplication by the constant function 1 is the identity operator. -/
example : mulL2_constant 1 = ContinuousLinearMap.id ℂ (Lp ℂ 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)) := by
  sorry

/-- **Scaling**: Multiplication by a scaled function scales the operator. -/
example (c : ℂ) (ϕ : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ) :
    mulL2_BoundedContinuous (c • ϕ) = c • mulL2_BoundedContinuous ϕ := by
  sorry

/-! ## Connection to Physics

In QFT, multiplication operators arise naturally:
1. **Position multiplication**: x ↦ x · ψ(x) (unbounded but important)
2. **Cutoff functions**: Smooth functions that localize in space or momentum
3. **Test functions**: Multiplication by smooth, compactly supported functions
4. **Modulation**: Multiplication by oscillatory functions like e^{ikx}

The bounded continuous function approach handles cases 2, 3, and the bounded
parts of case 4. For case 1 (position operator), one needs unbounded operator theory.
-/

/-- **Example**: Gaussian cutoff function (bounded on any finite interval). -/
def gaussianCutoff (σ : ℝ) (hσ : 0 < σ) : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ := by
  -- ϕ(x) = exp(-x²/(2σ²)) is bounded and continuous
  sorry

/-- **Example**: Characteristic function of a bounded interval. -/
def intervalCutoff (a b : ℝ) (hab : a < b) : BoundedContinuousFunction ℝ ℂ := by
  -- This requires a continuous approximation since the exact characteristic
  -- function is discontinuous. We can use a smooth approximation.
  sorry
