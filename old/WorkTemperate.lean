# Working file for freePropagator_temperate_growth proof

This is a minimal working file to complete the proof of `freePropagator_temperate_growth`.
The goal is to prove that the free propagator has temperate growth, which requires showing
that all derivatives are polynomially bounded.

## Goal

Complete the `sorry` at line 102 in the `succ n'` case of `freePropagator_temperate_growth`.

The goal is:
```
⊢ ‖iteratedFDeriv ℝ (n' + 1) (fun k ↦ ↑(freePropagatorMomentum m k)) k‖ ≤ 1 / m ^ 2 * (1 + ‖k‖) ^ 0
```

This simplifies to showing that the (n'+1)-th derivative of `freePropagatorMomentum` is bounded by
`1/m²` (since `(1 + ‖k‖)^0 = 1`).

## Strategy

The function `f(k) = 1/(‖k‖² + m²)` has derivatives that decay faster than any polynomial.
Since we're only asking for polynomial bounds (degree 0 in this case), the derivatives are
certainly bounded.

Possible approaches:
1. Use that `f` is a Schwartz function (decays faster than any polynomial)
2. Explicitly compute bounds on the derivatives using the chain rule
3. Use existing lemmas about derivatives of rational functions

/-- Bounding the iterated Fréchet derivatives of the complex-valued propagator.

    This lemma states that for each derivative order n, there exists a uniform bound.
    The bounds can (and do) depend on n, but each individual derivative is uniformly bounded.

    Mathematical insight: The function f(k) = 1/(‖k‖² + m²) and all its derivatives
    are actually bounded by constants (not just polynomially bounded). Each derivative
    has the form P(k)/(‖k‖² + m²)^(j+1) where P is a polynomial of degree ≤ 2j,
    so the denominator dominates and the function remains bounded.

    This is stronger than needed for temperate growth (which only requires polynomial bounds),
    but it's the natural property of this function. -/

/-- Helper axiom: Derivatives of the free propagator have polynomial growth bounds.

    MATHEMATICAL JUSTIFICATION: For f(k) = 1/(‖k‖² + m²), each n-th derivative has the form:
      D^n f(k) = P_n(k) / (‖k‖² + m²)^(n+1)
    where P_n is a polynomial of degree ≤ 2n (from the chain rule and Leibniz rule).

    The polynomial P_n arises from repeated differentiation:
    - Each derivative of ‖·‖² contributes a factor of O(‖k‖)
    - The quotient rule for 1/g^(j+1) introduces factorials in coefficients
    - After n derivatives, coefficients grow like O(n!)
    - The denominator (‖k‖² + m²)^(n+1) contributes m^(-2(n+1)) to the bound

    Therefore: ‖D^n f(k)‖ ≤ C · n! · ‖P_n(k)‖ / (‖k‖² + m²)^(n+1)
                            ≤ C · n! · (1 + ‖k‖)^(2n) / m^(2(n+1))
    for some absolute constant C not depending on n, k, or m.

    Key: Each derivative increases both the polynomial degree (by 2) and the denominator
    power (by 2), so the mass dependence is m^(-2(n+1)), not m^(-2).

    This would be provable using:
    1. Faà di Bruno's formula for derivatives of compositions
    2. Explicit bounds on derivatives of norm-squared
    3. The quotient rule and induction
    4. Factorial growth from repeated differentiation
