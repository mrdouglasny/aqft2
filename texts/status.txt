Status report (Oct 8, 2025)

Overview
--------
Major refactors and progress across Schwinger, GFFMconstruct, and GaussianFreeField modules:

- Organization
  • Moved SchwingerFunctionℂ₂ and CovarianceBilinear definitions to Aqft2/Schwinger.lean.
  • Extracted complex pairing algebra to new file Aqft2/ComplexTestFunction.lean:
    re/im combination lemmas, ω-linearity decompositions, and pairing_linear_combo.
  • Removed private wrapper SchwingerFunctionℂ₂_local and updated its usages.

- Bilinearity from integrability
  • Added CovarianceBilinear_of_integrable in Schwinger.lean:
    assumes Integrable (⟨ω,φ⟩⟨ω,ψ⟩) for all φ, ψ and proves full ℂ-bilinearity of S₂.
  • Simplifies proving CovarianceBilinear for specific measures by separating the analytic
    (integrability) input from the algebraic linearity of pairing.

- Gaussian Free Field (GFF)
  • Reproved covarianceBilinear_gaussianFreeField via CovarianceBilinear_of_integrable.
    Introduced gaussian_pairing_product_integrable_free (placeholder) for the required integrability.
  • gaussianFreeField_satisfies_OS0 now uses gaussian_satisfies_OS0 with the new bilinearity proof.
  • Moved alternate OS0 proofs (gaussian_satisfies_OS0_alt, gaussianFreeField_satisfies_OS0_alt)
    to old/GaussianFreeField_OS0_alt.lean.

- Minlos/Schwinger bridge
  • Kept schwinger_eq_Qc_free (GFF_Minlos_Complex) equating S₂ with MinlosAnalytic.Qc.
  • Began plan to prove gff_two_point_equals_covarianceℂ_free via a bridge lemma
    free_Qc_eq_freeCovarianceℂ (currently a placeholder) identifying Qc with the explicit
    Fourier-defined free covariance.

- Lint and hygiene
  • Removed global [SigmaFinite μ] section var in Schwinger.lean to satisfy linter.
  • Replaced fragile congr/ext goals in integrals with simp-based steps.

Current status by file
----------------------
Aqft2/Schwinger.lean
- DONE: SchwingerFunctionℂ₂ and CovarianceBilinear centralized here.
- DONE: CovarianceBilinear_of_integrable implemented.
- Lint: cleaned; only unrelated placeholders remain.

Aqft2/ComplexTestFunction.lean
- NEW: Houses pairing_linear_combo and helper lemmas (re/im combination, ω linearity).
- Used by Schwinger/GFFMconstruct.

Aqft2/GFFMconstruct.lean
- schwinger_eq_integral_product: present.
- mixed_deriv_minlos_Qc, mixed_deriv_schwinger: present with helper sorries for dominated-convergence and integrability.
- freeCovarianceForm_struct: structure present; add_left/smul_left remain TODO.
- gff_two_point_equals_covarianceℂ_free: goal lemma; now planned to follow from
  schwinger_eq_Qc_free + free_Qc_eq_freeCovarianceℂ (bridge placeholder added).

Aqft2/GaussianFreeField.lean
- gaussian_satisfies_OS0: generic theorem (complete).
- covarianceBilinear_gaussianFreeField: now reduced to integrability (one placeholder lemma).
- gaussianFreeField_satisfies_OS0: uses gaussian_satisfies_OS0 and new bilinearity proof.
- gaussian_satisfies_OS1: two placeholders remain (product→sum bound and TwoPointIntegrable).
- OS2 path is complete given CovarianceEuclideanInvariantℂ assumption.
- OS4 skeleton remains with placeholders (translate_test_function and clustering proof).

Aqft2/GFF_OS3.lean and Aqft2/OS3.lean
- OS3 framework in place; still requires reflection invariance/positivity via free covariance
  and matrix PSD-of-exp lemma from HadamardExp.

Aqft2/HadamardExp.lean
- Needs the “entrywise exp preserves PSD” lemma finalized to close an OS3 step.

What’s proven vs pending (high level)
-------------------------------------
- OS0 (generic): gaussian_satisfies_OS0 is complete.
- OS0 (GFF): reduces to integrability of ⟨ω,φ⟩⟨ω,ψ⟩ under μ_GFF (single placeholder lemma).
- OS1 (GFF): proof skeleton present; two small analytic sorries remain.
- OS2 (GFF): holds under CovarianceEuclideanInvariantℂ; needs a GFF-specific lemma to discharge the hypothesis.
- OS3 (GFF): framework in place; pending reflection invariance/positivity from free covariance and exp-PSD lemma.
- OS4 (GFF): skeleton with placeholders; needs translation operator + propagator decay.

Action items (next steps)
-------------------------
1) Close OS0 for GFF
   - Prove gaussian_pairing_product_integrable_free (finite moments for GFF pairings).
   - Optional: Finish free_Qc_eq_freeCovarianceℂ and then gff_two_point_equals_covarianceℂ_free.

2) Finish OS1 details
   - Provide a clean inequality to convert M·‖f‖₁·‖f‖₂ into a sum bound inside exp.
   - Supply TwoPointIntegrable for p = 2 using kernel or nuclearity bounds.

3) Provide GFF-specific invariances
   - CovarianceEuclideanInvariantℂ (μ_GFF m) from free covariance invariance.
   - Reflection invariance/positivity via explicit covariance (for OS3).

4) HadamardExp lemma
   - Finalize entrywise exp preserves PSD for real symmetric PSD matrices, then
     plug into OS3.

5) OS4
   - Implement translate_test_function on Schwartz/TestFunction.
   - Prove CovarianceClustering using massive propagator decay; finish OS4 skeleton.

Build status
------------
- All edited files build with only the intended placeholder warnings (sorries) remaining.
- No outstanding linter errors after removing the unused section variable in Schwinger.

Notes
-----
- The integrability-based approach to bilinearity has simplified OS0 for GFF to a single,
  well-scoped analytic step (finite moments), separated from algebraic linearity.
- The Minlos/Schwinger bridge remains a viable alternate route for S₂ = freeCovarianceℂ.
