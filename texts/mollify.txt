Mollified construction plan for the massive GFF (existence via ε ↓ 0)

Goal
- Prove OS axioms from the Gaussian generating functional Z(f) = exp(−1/2 ⟨f, G_m f⟩).
- Obtain the probability measure μ_m by constructing mollified Gaussians μ_ε and taking a weak limit ε ↓ 0.

Key points
- Keep m > 0 (no IR issue).
- Mollified measures μ_ε are centered Gaussians with covariance G_ε = G_m * (ρ_ε * ṽρ_ε) * G_m.
- μ_ε generally do NOT satisfy reflection positivity (RP); that’s fine: use μ_ε only for existence.
- Prove RP and Euclidean invariance directly for the target covariance G_m; transfer to μ_m.

Step 1 — Covariance layer (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
1. Mollifier and scaling
   - Fix ρ ∈ 𝒮 with ∫ ρ = 1 and define ρ_ε(x) = ε^{−d} ρ(x/ε).

2. Define mollified covariance forms
   - Fourier multiplier: M_m(k) = 1/(|k|^2 + m^2).
   - Mollified multiplier: M_{ε}(k) = |ρ̂(ε k)|^2 · M_m(k).
   - Define, for real test functions f,g ∈ 𝒮(ℝ^d):
       C_ε(f,g) := ∫ M_{ε}(k) · f̂(k) · ĝ(k) dk / (2π)^d.
     Provide complex extension C_ε^ℂ similarly.

3. Properties
   - Positivity / Hermitian: C_ε is Hermitian positive semidefinite (multiplier ≥ 0).
   - Euclidean invariance: C_ε is translation-rotation invariant (M_{ε} is radial in k).
   - Uniform bound: C_ε(f,f) ≤ C · ∫ (|f̂(k)|^2/(|k|^2 + m^2)) dk ≲ ‖f‖_{H^1}^2 with C independent of ε.
   - Convergence: for each f, C_ε(f,f) → C(f,f) by dominated convergence (|ρ̂(ε k)| → 1, |ρ̂| ≤ 1).

4. Target covariance OS facts (for C = C_m)
   - Spectral/time-slice representation:
       C(t,x) = ∫_{ℝ^{d-1}} e^{−ω(p) |t|} e^{i p·x} (2 ω(p))^{−1} dp,  ω(p) = √(|p|^2 + m^2).
   - Reflection positivity (RP): for f supported in t ≥ 0,
       ∑_i,j c̄_i c_j ⟨θ f_i, C f_j⟩ = ∫ (2ω)^{−1} |∫_0^∞ e^{−ω t} ẑf_i(p,t) dt|^2 dp ≥ 0.
   - Euclidean invariance: immediate from radial multiplier M_m(k).

Step 2 — Construct the mollified Gaussians (Aqft2/GFFK.lean or GFFMconstruct.lean)
1. For ε > 0, define μ_ε as the centered Gaussian measure with covariance C_ε
   - Use your existing Kolmogorov/Minlos constructor with covariance form C_ε (real or complex version as needed).

2. Generating functional
   - Prove: ∀ f,  Z_ε(f) := 𝔼_{μ_ε}[exp(i⟨ω, f⟩)] = exp(−1/2 · C_ε(f,f)).
   - This is by design of the Minlos/Kolmogorov constructor.

Step 3 — Convergence μ_ε ⇒ μ_m (ε ↓ 0)
1. Pointwise convergence of Z_ε(f): by C_ε(f,f) → C(f,f).
2. Equicontinuity at 0: uniform bound C_ε(f,f) ≤ const · ‖f‖_{H^1}^2.
3. Apply Lévy–Sazonov (Gaussian measures on nuclear space 𝒮′) to conclude μ_ε ⇒ μ_m.
4. Define μ_m as this limit; its characteristic functional is Z(f) = exp(−1/2 · C(f,f)).

Step 4 — OS axioms from the generating functional (Aqft2/GFF_OS3.lean)
1. Reflection positivity: use the spectral/time-slice representation of C (Step 1.4) to prove RP directly for Z.
2. Euclidean invariance: from the radial multiplier (Step 1.4) and Gaussian invariance.
3. Hermitian symmetry: immediate for Gaussian with real symmetric covariance.
4. Conclude OS for μ_m.

Notes / pitfalls
- μ_ε typically fails RP; do not use μ_ε for RP—prove RP for the limiting C and then apply to μ_m.
- Keep m > 0; for m = 0, work on the torus and project out the zero mode.
- For rigorous Step 3, reference Sazonov/Lévy continuity for Gaussian measures on 𝒮′.
- Finite-volume variants (torus) can be used to justify dominated convergence and bounds if needed.
