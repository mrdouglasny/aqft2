Yes—there’s a clean, general “differentiate under the integral” criterion, and in your Gaussian setup it applies immediately.

# A handy master theorem (Lebesgue–dominated differentiation)

Let ((\Omega,\mathcal F,\mu)) be a measure space. Suppose (g:\mathbb R\times\Omega\to\mathbb C) satisfies:

1. For each (t), (x\mapsto g(t,x)) is integrable.
2. For a.e. (x), (t\mapsto g(t,x)) is differentiable with derivative (\partial_t g(t,x)).
3. There is an integrable (H(x)\in L^1(\mu)) and a neighborhood (I\ni t_0) such that
   [
   |\partial_t g(t,x)|\le H(x)\quad\text{for all }t\in I\text{ and a.e. }x.
   ]

Then (F(t):=\int g(t,x),d\mu(x)) is differentiable at (t_0) and
[
F'(t_0)=\int \partial_t g(t_0,x),d\mu(x).
]
(Proof: write the difference quotient and use dominated convergence on (\partial_t g).)

There are many variants (uniform integrability, Vitali, etc.), but this is the workhorse.

# Apply it to (g(t,x)=e^{itX(x)})

Take a real random variable (X\in L^1) on ((\Omega,\mu)) and
[
g(t,x):=e^{itX(x)},\qquad \partial_t g(t,x)= i,X(x),e^{itX(x)}.
]
Since (|e^{itX}|=1), the bound
[
|\partial_t g(t,x)|=|X(x)|
]
works for **all** (t). If (\mathbb E|X|<\infty) then the theorem gives
[
\frac{d}{dt},\mathbb E!\left[e^{itX}\right]
= \mathbb E!\left[iX,e^{itX}\right].
]

A slightly more elementary proof uses the identity
[
\frac{e^{i(t+h)X}-e^{itX}}{h}-iX e^{itX}
= iX e^{itX}\Big(\frac{e^{ihX}-1}{ihX}-1\Big),
]
with (\big|\tfrac{e^{iy}-1}{iy}\big|\le 1) for all (y), giving the domination
[
\Big|\frac{e^{i(t+h)X}-e^{itX}}{h}-iX e^{itX}\Big|\le 2|X|,
]
and pointwise convergence to (0). Dominated convergence with (2|X|\in L^1) then yields the result.

# Higher derivatives

If (X\in L^k) then the same argument iterated gives
[
\frac{d^k}{dt^k},\mathbb E[e^{itX}]= i^k,\mathbb E!\big[X^k e^{itX}\big],
]
so the characteristic function is (C^k). For a Gaussian (X), all moments are finite, hence the characteristic function is (C^\infty) and even real-analytic.

# In your constructive QFT setting

For a smeared field (\phi(f)=\langle X,f\rangle) (with (f) real), the pushforward under your Gaussian measure is 1-D Gaussian. Therefore (\phi(f)\in L^p) for every (p<\infty). In particular, (\mathbb E|\phi(f)|<\infty), so the theorem applies and
[
\frac{d}{dt},\mathbb E!\left[e^{it\phi(f)}\right]
= \mathbb E!\left[i,\phi(f),e^{it\phi(f)}\right].
]

# If you want a one-line “axiom” to cite

For Gaussian measures on (separable) locally convex spaces, **Fernique’s theorem** gives exponential integrability of every continuous linear functional. That immediately implies the (L^k) hypotheses above for all (k), hence all under-the-integral derivatives of the characteristic functional are justified.
