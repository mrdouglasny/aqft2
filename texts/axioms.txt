Axiom Catalog (as of 2025-10-15)
===============================

This document tracks every axiom currently assumed in the `aqft2` project and records the
mathematical justification or planned proof strategy for each. Update entries as proofs are
added or assumptions are relaxed.

1. gaussianFreeField_pairing_memLp (Aqft2/GFFMconstruct.lean)
   Statement: For every mass `m > 0`, real test function `φ`, and finite exponent `p`, the
   smeared field `⟨ω, φ⟩` belongs to `Lᵖ` under the free Gaussian measure.
   Status/Justification: Treated axiomatically because proving general Lᵖ bounds for Schwartz
   distributions requires handling seminormed strong-dual topology intricacies. Once the theory
   is reformulated using Hölder-space distributions, a direct argument via Banach-valued
   Gaussian measures should discharge this axiom.
   Counts: 1 axiom / 0 sorrys in this section.

2. gaussianFreeField_pairing_expSq_integrable (Aqft2/GFFMconstruct.lean)
   Statement: Exponential square integrability of smeared fields for the free GFF.
   Status/Justification: Placeholder for a Fernique-type result. Expected to follow from the same
   infrastructure that addresses `gaussianFreeField_pairing_memLp`.
   Counts: 1 axiom / 0 sorrys in this section.

3. gaussianFreeField_free_centered (Aqft2/GFFMconstruct.lean)
   Statement: The free Gaussian measure is centered.
   Status/Justification: Consequence of symmetry under `ω ↦ -ω`. Marked as an axiom until the
   pushforward argument is written out explicitly.
   Counts: 1 axiom / 0 sorrys in this section.

4. gaussianFreeField_free_isGaussian (Aqft2/GFFMconstruct.lean)
   Statement: The Minlos-constructed measure is Gaussian in Mathlib's sense.
   Status/Justification: Assumed to avoid re-deriving every Gaussian-structure lemma. Document
   the precise translation from Minlos construction to Mathlib's `IsGaussian` when convenient.
   Counts: 1 axiom / 0 sorrys in this section.

5. nuclear_TestFunctionR (Aqft2/GFFMconstruct.lean)
   Statement: Real test functions form a nuclear space.
   Status/Justification: Standard fact about Schwartz spaces. The axiom stands in until the
   nuclearity proof is imported or replicated from existing references.
   Counts: 1 axiom / 0 sorrys in this section.

6. Schwartz/propagator analytic prerequisites (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
   Statements: schwartz_L2_integrable, freePropagator_temperate_growth, schwartz_mul_by_temperate,
   integrable_schwartz_weighted_by_propagator, integrable_weighted_schwartz,
   freeCovariance_exponential_decay_basic, covarianceBilinearForm_continuous_basic,
   integral_star_comm, momentum_covariance_integrable.
   Status/Justification: Standard results about Schwartz functions and the massive propagator
   (tempered growth, rapid decay, and basic integral manipulations). They are assumed while we
   wait for the corresponding Mathlib lemmas or custom analytic proofs.
   Counts: 9 axioms / 2 nearby sorrys (`freeCovariance_symmetric`, `freeCovariance_euclidean_invariant`).

7. Fourier and time-reflection identities (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
   Statements: fubini_theorem_for_propagator, parseval_convolution_theorem, ft_kernel_identity,
   complex_integral_to_real_inner_product, parseval_schwartz_basic,
   parseval_covariance_schwartz, parseval_time_reflection_covariance,
   parseval_time_reflection_covariance_explicit, time_reflection_fourier_identity.
   Status/Justification: Package the Fourier-analytic equalities underpinning reflection
   positivity. Replacing them with proofs will require a dedicated Parseval/Plancherel toolkit for
   SchwartzMap maps and the propagator kernel. The explicit time-reflection Parseval identity is
   especially high-priority: Glimm–Jaffe derive it via a contour integral argument, so we either
   need to formalize that proof or find an alternative derivation.
   Counts: 9 axioms / same 2 outstanding sorrys in `Aqft2/Covariance.lean`.

8. Heat-kernel reduction package (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
   Statements: SpatialToL2, covariance_to_heat_kernel_lemma,
   spatial_reduction_heat_kernel_axiom, integrable_time_reflection_weighted_explicit,
   integrable_time_reflection_weighted.
   Status/Justification: Bridges between covariance expressions and heat-kernel semigroups. These
   assumptions stand in for the analytic estimates that will be imported from future heat-kernel
   development.
   Counts: 5 axioms / same 2 outstanding sorrys in `Aqft2/Covariance.lean`.

9. Bilinear integrability scaffolding (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
   Statements: freeCovarianceℂ_bilinear_integrable, freeCovarianceℂ_bilinear_inner_integrable,
   freeCovarianceℂ_bilinear_slice_integrable.
   Status/Justification: Supply the integrability hypotheses needed to justify Fubini-type
   manipulations in the complex covariance bilinear form. Once the decay estimates are formalized,
   these will be proven and the derived bilinearity theorems will remain intact without axioms.
   Counts: 3 axioms / same 2 outstanding sorrys in `Aqft2/Covariance.lean`.

10. Gaussian measure scaffolding (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
    Statements: freeCovarianceℂ_diagonal_real_basic, gaussianMeasureGFF_exists,
    gaussianMeasureGFF_correlationℂ_basic, gaussianMeasureGFF_correlationℂ,
    freeCovariance_OS1_bound_basic, freeCovariance_OS3_basic.
    Status/Justification: Axiomatize the Minlos Gaussian measure with its OS-axiom behaviour until
    the construction is mechanized end-to-end.
   Counts: 6 axioms / same 2 outstanding sorrys in `Aqft2/Covariance.lean`.

11. Real covariance form infrastructure (Aqft2/Covariance.lean)
    Statements: sqrtPropagatorEmbedding, freeCovarianceFormR_continuous,
    freeCovarianceFormR_pos, freeCovarianceFormR_symm, freeCovarianceFormR_add_left,
    freeCovarianceFormR_smul_left, freeCovarianceFormR_add_right, freeCovarianceFormR_smul_right.
    Status/Justification: Capture the real-valued bilinear form properties required for Minlos and
    reflection-positivity arguments. Proofs will follow from the same analytic input as the complex
    theory.
   Counts: 8 axioms / same 2 outstanding sorrys in `Aqft2/Covariance.lean`.

12. translate_test_function (Aqft2/GaussianFreeField.lean)
   Statement: Definition is currently a placeholder (`sorry`).
   Status/Justification: Listed here to track that clustering uses an undeclared translation map.
   Counts: 0 axioms / 1 sorry (definition placeholder).

13. gaussianFreeField_satisfies_OS4_clustering (Aqft2/GaussianFreeField.lean)
   Statement: Clustering proof remains incomplete (`sorry`).
   Status/Justification: Pending detailed decay estimates for the covariance.
   Counts: 0 axioms / 1 sorry (clustering proof placeholder).

14. Remaining `sorry` placeholders
    Many analytic lemmas across the project are marked with `sorry` (see `texts/status.txt` for a
    complete list). While not axioms in the strict sense, they represent technical gaps that must
   be resolved.
   Counts: 0 axioms / numerous sorrys (tracked in `texts/status.txt`).

Please ensure any new axioms are added here with clear mathematical rationale and, when possible,
references to standard results.
