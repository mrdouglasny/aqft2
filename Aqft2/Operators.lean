/-! ## Multiplication Operators on L² Spaces

This file provides a general framework for multiplication operators on L² spaces over arbitrary
measure spaces. The key results are:

1. **Bounded continuous functions** give bounded multiplication operators
2. **L∞ functions** give bounded multiplication operators

These lemmas can then be applied to specific spaces in QFT and other applications.

/-! ## Core Multiplication Lemmas

These are the fundamental results for multiplication operators on L² spaces.

We start with a warmup for continuous functions, then move to L² spaces.

/-- **Warmup Lemma**: Bounded continuous functions give bounded multiplication operators on C⁰.

If ϕ : α → ℝ is bounded and continuous, then pointwise multiplication by ϕ defines a bounded linear operator
on C⁰(α, ℝ) with ‖T_ϕ‖ ≤ ‖ϕ‖∞. This is a good warmup for the L² case. -/

/-! ## Summary

This file provides the core infrastructure for multiplication operators on L² spaces:

### Core Lemmas (to be proved)
- `mulL2_of_boundedContinuous`: Bounded continuous functions → bounded operators
- `mulL2_of_Linfty`: L∞ functions → bounded operators

### Constructors
- `mulL2_BoundedContinuous`: Operator constructor from bounded continuous functions
- `mulL2_Linfty`: Operator constructor from L∞ functions

### Properties
- Norm bounds: ‖T_ϕ‖ ≤ ‖ϕ‖
- Multiplication property: T f =ᵐ[μ] fun x => ϕ x • f x (almost everywhere equality)
- Linearity: T(f + cg) = Tf + cTg

**Important**: The multiplication property uses almost everywhere equality (=ᵐ[μ])
because L² functions are equivalence classes of functions equal almost everywhere,
not pointwise functions.

This framework can be imported and used in other files for specific applications
like QFT heat kernel operators, without polluting those files with the general theory.

The main lemmas `mulL2_of_boundedContinuous` and `mulL2_of_Linfty` use `sorry` and
need to be proved. Once proved, all the constructors and applications will work.
