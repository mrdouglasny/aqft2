/-! ## Positive Definiteness -/

/-- A function φ : α → ℂ is positive definite if for any finite collection
    of points x₁, ..., xₘ and complex coefficients c₁, ..., cₘ, we have
    ∑ᵢⱼ c̄ᵢ cⱼ φ(xᵢ - xⱼ) ≥ 0

    This is the standard definition in harmonic analysis and probability theory. -/
def IsPositiveDefinite {α : Type*} [AddGroup α] (φ : α → ℂ) : Prop :=

/-! ## Bochner's Theorem -/

/-- Bochner's theorem in finite dimensions (ℝⁿ):
    A continuous positive-definite function φ with φ(0) = 1 is the Fourier transform
    (characteristic function) of a unique probability measure.

    This is a fundamental result connecting harmonic analysis and probability theory.
    The infinite-dimensional generalization (Minlos theorem) is used to construct
    the Gaussian Free Field. -/

/-! ## Minlos Theorem -/

/-- A nuclear locally convex space. This is a placeholder for the proper nuclear space structure.
    In practice, E would be the Schwartz space S(ℝᵈ) with its nuclear topology. -/

variable {E : Type*} [AddCommGroup E] [Module ℝ E] [TopologicalSpace E]

-- We need a measurable space structure on the weak dual
instance : MeasurableSpace (WeakDual ℝ E) := borel _

/-- **Minlos Theorem**: Existence of infinite-dimensional probability measures.

    Let E be a nuclear locally convex space and let Φ : E → ℂ be a characteristic functional.
    If Φ is:
    1. Continuous (with respect to the nuclear topology on E)
    2. Positive definite (in the sense of Bochner)
    3. Normalized: Φ(0) = 1

    Then there exists a unique probability measure μ on the topological dual E'
    (equipped with the weak* topology) such that:

    Φ(f) = ∫_{E'} exp(i⟨f,ω⟩) dμ(ω)

    **Applications**:
    - For E = S(ℝᵈ) (Schwartz space), E' = S'(ℝᵈ) (tempered distributions)
    - Gaussian measures: Φ(f) = exp(-½⟨f, Cf⟩) with nuclear covariance C
    - Construction of the Gaussian Free Field

    **Historical Note**: This theorem, proved by R.A. Minlos in 1959, is fundamental
    to the construction of infinite-dimensional Gaussian measures in quantum field theory. -/

    characteristic functional, then they are equal. -/

    positive semidefinite forms are positive definite.

/-- Application of Minlos theorem to Gaussian measures.
    If the covariance form can be realized as a squared norm via a linear embedding T into
    a real normed vector space H, then the Gaussian characteristic functional Φ(f) = exp(-½⟨f, Cf⟩)
    satisfies the conditions of Minlos theorem, yielding a Gaussian probability measure on E'. -/

/-- The measure constructed by Minlos theorem for a Gaussian characteristic functional
    indeed has that functional as its characteristic function.

    This theorem makes explicit that the Gaussian measure μ constructed via Minlos
    satisfies: for any test function f,
    ∫ ω, exp(i⟨f,ω⟩) dμ(ω) = exp(-½⟨f,Cf⟩)

    This is the fundamental property connecting the abstract Minlos construction
    to the concrete Gaussian generating functional used in quantum field theory. -/
